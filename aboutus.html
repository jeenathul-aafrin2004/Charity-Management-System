    <h3>Who we are</h3>
    <p>
      HopeNest is a student-driven initiative built to uplift underprivileged children and orphans.
We are developers, learners, and changemakers passionate about equal access to Needs.
Our platform bridges the gap between students in need and kind-hearted donors.
We believe technology can drive compassion and create real-world impact.

    <h3>What we do</h3>
    <p>
      We provide a transparent platform for students to post genuine requests.
Donors can browse, verify, and fund these requests directly with ease and trust.
Each request includes details like amount, purpose, and student background.
We ensure every donation goes where it's neededâ€”with accountability and updates.

    <h3>Why we do it</h3>
    <p>
      Millions of students lack basic resources due to poverty and lack of support.
We believe that no dream should be limited by financial barriers.
By connecting caring donors with real stories, we ignite hope and opportunity.
Our mission is to nurture futures, empower learning, and spark long-term change.
